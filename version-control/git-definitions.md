# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
		Version control manages changes done by the members of a given project over time. It is useful since it keeps a project nicely organized and people can go back to a previous version of their project if needed.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
		A branch is a copy of the main codebase so multiple coders can work on
		different parts of a project without altering and potentially messing up the main codebase.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
		A commit is basically a save point for a project at a specific time that a coder can rollback to if needed. A good commit message is succinct and describes the changes that were made.

* What is a merge conflict?
		A merge conflict is when two different branches have altered the same items so git does not know which one should be used for the merge.
