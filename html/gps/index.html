What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	Semantic tags make the website much more readable for search engines as well as people using screen readers. The nav, header, and footer tags seem most useful to me. I feel that I have to force the usage of the other tags for these simpler websites I'm creating currently.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	It displays things from top to bottom and then external elements such as images or style sheets would get loaded.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	Creating snippets was brand new to me. I could see how they would be extremely useful to create pages for a new website. Every page could be halfway complete with a quick tab command.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	The symantec elements currently seem like a roundabout way to do things. I think I will appreciate it more as I build larger websites and learn more about how it is an important factor for SEO and assistive reading devices.
